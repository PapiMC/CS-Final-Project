# CS-Final-Project
Object Oriented Programming in Python.
Most important files for viewing Object Oriented structure are Controller.py and Model.py, coded by Logen and Zach.
This was built by the following four students: Micah, Zach, Megan, and Hayden.
The comments of the code are detailed with who built what (much of the work is collaborative, as is the nature of a final project).
This code is also in a repo on Zach's account, so much of this code will be very similar, some will be changed since the project submission.
